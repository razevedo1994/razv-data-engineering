Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

Project Description
In this project, we will apply data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, we will define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytical focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories to these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
